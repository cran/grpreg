## Frequently asked questions

1. Is it possible to fit MC+ and SCAD models without an intercept?  This option is provided in the lars package.

I contend that there is no conceivable situation in which fitting a penalized regression model without an intercept would make sense.  I am open to being convinced otherwise on this matter, but until someone convinces me, I do not wish to encourage bad statistical practice.
