*   Minor change
**  Major change

2.3-0
	*  Switched to SVD-based orthogonalization to allow for linear
	   dependency within groups

2.2-1
	*  Fixed compilation error for 32-bit Windows
	*  Fixed bug in calculation of binomial deviance when fitted
	   probabilities close to 0 or 1 arise

2.2-0 
        *  cv.grpreg: Now returns full data fit as well as CV errors
        *  The above thereby allows cv.grpreg to handle constant columns,
	   and fixes some bugs
        *  select: Now allows ... options to be passed to logLik
	*  plot: Added option to plot norm of each group, rather than
	   individual coefficients
	*  predict: "vars", "groups", and "norm" options added
	*  logLik: fixed bug -- no longer calculates (meaningless)
	   log-likelihoods for saturated models (thank you to Xiaowei Ren 
	   for pointing this out)
	*  fixed bug for returning group when some groups were eliminated
	   due to constant columns

2.1-0
	*  Fixed bug involving orthogonalization with unpenalized groups
        *  grpreg can now handle constant columns (they produce beta=0)
	*  Internal restructuring of C code

2.0-0
	** New algorithm for group lasso
	** (L2) Group MCP, group SCAD methods added
	** Added cv.ncvreg to facilitate cross-validation
	*  Extensive internal refactoring of code
	*  Added dfmax option
	*  Added group.multiplier option
	*  Allows specification of unpenalized groups
	*  standardize and orthogonalize functions added
	*  gBridge now divorced from grpreg and given separate function
	*  Much more extensive and reproducible code testing

1.2-0
	*  DESCRIPTION: Fixed contact info
	*  CITATION: Updated citation
	*  grpreg: Removed 'monitor' option
	*  grpreg: Changed 'n.lambda' to 'nlambda'
	*  grpreg: Changed 'a' to 'gamma' for MCP tuning parameter
	*  grpreg: Changed 'lambda2' to 'alpha'
	*  grpreg: Added 'loss' to value returned
	** grpreg.c: Fixed bug in calculation of df for gLasso
	*  logLik: Added logLik method
	** select: Syntax modified (no longer requires X, y to be passed)
        *  criteria: Obsolete, removed
	** plot.grpreg: Made plotting function more flexible
