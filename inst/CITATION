citHeader("If you use any of the L2-norm penalties (penalty='grLasso', 'grMCP', or 'grSCAD'), cite the Statistics and Computing article.  If you use the group exponential lasso (penalty='gel'), cite the preprint (check my website for its arXiv citation number).  If you use the composite MCP (penalty='cMCP'), cite the Statistics and its Interface (2009) article; note that this penalty is referred to as the 'group MCP' in the original article, but it would be better to refer to it as 'composite MCP' in future works.")
