\title{Risk Factors Associated with Low Infant Birth Weight}
\description{
  The \code{Birthwt} data contains 189 observations, 16 predictors, and
  an outcome, birthweight, available both as a continuous measure and a
  binary indicator for low birth weight.  The data were
  collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass during 1986.
  This data frame is a reparameterization of the \code{birthwt} data
  frame from the \code{MASS} package.

\usage{
data(Birthwt)
}
\format{
  The \code{Birthwt} object is a list containing four elements:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{bwt}:}{Birth weight in kilograms}
    \item{\code{low}:}{Indicator of birth weight less than 2.5kg}
    \item{\code{X}:}{Matrix of predictors}
    \item{\code{group}:}{Vector describing how the columns of X are
      grouped}
  }
  The matrix \code{X} contains the following columns:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{age1,age2,age3}:}{Orthogonal polynomials of
      first, second, and third degree representing mother's age in
      years}
    \item{\code{lwt1,lwt2,lwt3}:}{Orthogonal polynomials of
      first, second, and third degree representing mother's weight in
      pounds at last menstrual period}
    \item{\code{white,black}:}{Indicator functions for mother's race;
      "other" is reference group}
    \item{\code{smoke}:}{Smoking status during pregnancy}
    \item{\code{ptl1,ptl2m}:}{Indicator functions for one or for two or
      more previous premature labors, respectively.  No previous
      premature labors is the reference category.}
    \item{\code{ht}:}{History of hypertension}
    \item{\code{ui}:}{Presence of uterine irritability}
    \item{\code{ftv1,ftv2,ftv3m}:}{Indicator functions for
      one, for two, or for three or more physician visits during the
      first trimester, respectively.  No visits is the reference
      category.}
